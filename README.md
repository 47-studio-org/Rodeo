# NFT Gallery
NFT Gallery is a static site generator (SSG) that builds a gallery of your collected and created NFTs to showcase on your website. 

## How it works:
1. First, using Wallet Connect you will connect with your Ethereum wallet of choice
2. NFT Gallery will pull in all of the NFTs that you currently collect or have created
3. Next you can hide specific NFTs that you do not want to include in your gallery
4. Pick a theme for your gallery
5. Download a ZIP file with your static site, or deploy it into a Git repository of your choice
6. Enjoy your new public gallery that's all your own!

## How to deploy:
