# NFT Gallery

NFT Gallery is a static site generator (SSG) that builds a gallery of your collected and created NFTs to showcase on your website.

# Quickstart

If you want to run your own instance of rodeo, generally the best way is to use our CLI tool

```
npx giddyup mygallery
```

After a few questions this will create a new rodeo project in the ./mygallery directory.

Next, change directories to your gallery

```
cd mygallery
```

And start the dev server:

```
rodeo dev
```

Your local server will be running on [http://localhost:1999](http://localhost:1999)
